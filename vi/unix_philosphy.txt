The Unix Philosophy
From The Unix Programming Environment (1984) by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike

Even though the UNIX system introduces a number of innovative programs and techniques, n osingle program or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes it effective is the approach to progamming, a philsoophy of using the computer. Although that philosophy can't be written down in a single sentence, at it's heart is the idea that the powre of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves. Many UNIX programs do quite trival things in isoation, but combined with other programs, become general and uesful tools.
