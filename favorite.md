with the limited exposure I've had to each text editor, at this time my favorite is nano.  The commands were simple to learn, you could always 'escape' if something went wrong and it felt overall more beginner-friendly.  
I am sure there are reasons why nano does not seem to be the preferred text editor (this is the feeling I get from the internet, which I relied on heavily for this exercise), but for our beginner purposes my needs were met and it seemed to be the easiest to use.

As for "dislikes", I didnt have as easy of a time reading text because it does not wrap automatically.
